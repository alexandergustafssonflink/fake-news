HARTFORD, Conn. — Harvest Jam music festival attendees are still helping a fellow fan crowd-surf, blissfully unaware they’ve been hoisting a cadaver over their heads for nearly three hours. 

“Holy shit — that guy can really hang in there. He’s outlasted every stupid beachball in this place and shows no signs of slowing down,” said festival goer Deepak Mahbubani, marveling at the dead man’s crowd surfing technique. “That’s a dude who knows the secret, man: you just gotta go limp and let the flow move you. He’s even managed to stay up there between bands — that’s a level of commitment most people just don’t have.”

The body is rumored to be that of David Hearsh, a guitar tech who fell off the stage earlier today after inhaling tainted vape juice — an act falsely interpreted by the entire crowd as “being in the groove.”
